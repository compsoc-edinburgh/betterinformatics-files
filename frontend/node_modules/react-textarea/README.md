> `<textarea />` replacement

with `autoGrow` and `resize` support


## Motivation
 
 * Most often you only need the textarea `value` on the `onChange` handler. Just as often, you don't need `change` event propagation.

 * `autoGrow` is a very nice to have feature on a textarea. Coupled with `maxHeight` and `resize`


## Props

 * `onChange(value: String [, event ]): Function` - the `onChange` handler will be called with the textarea value, not the `event` object as first argument. The `event` object is the second arg to the callback function.
 * `stopChangePropagation: Boolean` - defaults to true. By default, the propagation of the change event will be stopped. All other evens will work as usual. Set this prop to `false` to allow `change` event propagation.
 * `autoGrow: Boolean` - defaults to true.
 * `resize: Boolean|String` - defaults to true - making the textarea resizable in both directions. Pass `false` or `String` to change this behaviour.
 * `maxHeight: Number|String` - the max height the textarea can have.

## Development
